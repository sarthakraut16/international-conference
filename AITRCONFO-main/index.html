                <h1>About </h1>
                <p>In the 21st century, innovation and entrepreneurship are vital for economic growth, social progress,
                    and environmental sustainability. NEP 2020 emphasizes nurturing creativity and critical thinking to
                    foster innovation in learners, making education a foundation for knowledge creation and contributing
                    to the national economy. By prioritizing these aspects, NEP 2020 aims to develop a generation of
                    thinkers and problem-solvers who can drive the nation forward.
                    Traditional educational approaches are inadequate in a rapidly changing world with technological
                    advancements, dynamic global markets, and evolving societal challenges. As the pace of change
                    accelerates, it becomes increasingly clear that merely imparting knowledge is not enough;
                    educational institutions must also focus on developing critical life skills.
                    <br><br> Entrepreneurship is
                    essential for economic growth and job creation, as it encourages individuals to take initiative,
                    innovate, and create new opportunities. Research reports highlight the need to revamp education to
                    equip students with 21st-century skills, preparing them for the evolving professional challenges.
                    These skills include adaptability, digital literacy, and the ability to collaborate across diverse
                    teams. <br><br>
                    In this context, Acropolis Institute of Technology and Research is organizing an International
                    Conference on ‘Innovation, Incubation, and IPR (ICI³2024: Promoting Sustainability and
                    Self-Reliance). This conference aims to catalyze entrepreneurial transformation in education. By
                    bringing together thought leaders, practitioners, and aspiring entrepreneurs, the event seeks to
                    create a vibrant ecosystem that supports innovation and sustainable development.
                    <br><br>
                    The conference offers academics, entrepreneurs, incubators, corporate professionals, faculty, school
                    teachers, students (HEI/School), and intrapreneurs a platform to learn about best practices across
                    the nation, share knowledge, and promote an entrepreneurial mindset. Participants will have the
                    opportunity to engage in interactive sessions, workshops, and networking events designed to foster
                    collaboration and inspire new ideas. It will inspire students to explore their entrepreneurial
                    ambitions at the nascent stage, encouraging them to think beyond conventional career paths and
                    consider the impact they can have through entrepreneurial ventures.
